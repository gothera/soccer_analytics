This repo unites separate work regarding keypoints/pitch detection, ball detection, players detection, in different sports such as football, basketball, tennis.
For the keypoint detection I used Yolo-pose models, which proved not so accurate comparing to HRNet(High resolution networks) which consists of multi-stage convolutions in order to accurately track keypoints positions
